# Cloud Gateway Controller

The [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is an API for
describing network gateways and configure routing from gateways to Kubernetes
services.

This repository contain a controller that implements the `Gateway` resource of
the Gateway API and creates `Gateway` and other resources in response. Hence,
this controller is a controller of controllers. This concept is described in
[Future of Cloud LB
Integration](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2022/slides/f3-K8sGatewayAPIs.pdf).
